# Mobile Development Setup with Expo Go

## Objective
Mobile development requires more computational resources than web development. To streamline the process, we use the **Expo Framework** for React Native, which simplifies mobile app development and testing.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:
- **Node.js LTS**
- **VS Code** (recommended IDE)
- **macOS, Linux, or Windows**
- **Expo Go** installed on your physical device (Android or iOS)

These tools are essential for efficiently completing upcoming projects.

## Instructions
By now, you should have **Node.js LTS**, **VS Code**, and a compatible operating system installed. This guide focuses on setting up **Expo Go** on your physical device.

## Why Expo Go?
Mobile development traditionally relies on device emulators for testing. However, keeping up with the rapidly evolving mobile ecosystem (e.g., iPhone 7 → iPhone 16 Pro Max, various Android devices) can be expensive and resource-intensive.

**Expo Go** provides a cost-effective solution by allowing you to test and run React Native applications directly on your physical device, supporting both **iOS** and **Android** seamlessly.
